      <h2>The Stelvio pass - A bit of road cycling history</h2>
      <p> Stelvio Pass cycling made the history of road bike, especially remembering the great climbs of Giro d'Italia champions, the famous annual multiple-stage bicycle race. The Stelvio Pass is considered the "Cima Coppi", that is the highest point reached during the whole competition.
            <br>
            <br>
        It was included for the first time in 1953 in the Bolzano-Bormio stage, where Fausto Coppi detached the leader Hugo Koblet. In this stage Coppi conquered the pink jersey and won his fifth and last “Giro”.
            <br>
            <br>
        It is worth mentioning that in 2010 for the first time the pass was the finish line of a stage of Giro Donne, i.e. the women's Giro d'Italia, with the triumph of Mara Abbott.
            <br>
