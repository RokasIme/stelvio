      The Stelvio Pass is almost 200 years old.
                                          It was constructed by an Austrian Emperor who wanted to join the valley to his homeland.
      It is pretty much unchanged since that time.
      It reaches over 2,700m high and is 31 miles long â€“ 49km.
      There are around 60 hairpin bends and 6 tunnels (although we lost count of the switchbacks after 20 as we were concentrating too much.)
      Stelvio may not be the most dangerous, although it is the highest paved road in the Eastern Alps.');">About</a>
